# BackgroundImage

**Introduced in version 1.2**

| Property | Type | Required | Description | Version |
| -------- | ---- | -------- | ----------- | ------- |
| **url** | `uri` | Yes | The URL (or data url) of the image. Acceptable formats are PNG, JPEG, and GIF | 1.2 |
| **fillMode** | `ImageFillMode` | No | Describes how the image should fill the area. | 1.2 |
| **horizontalAlignment** | `HorizontalAlignment` | No | Describes how the image should be aligned if it must be cropped or if using repeat fill mode. | 1.2 |
| **verticalAlignment** | `VerticalAlignment` | No | Describes how the image should be aligned if it must be cropped or if using repeat fill mode. | 1.2 |


## fillMode

Describes how the image should fill the area.

* **Type**: `ImageFillMode`
* **Required**: No
* **Allowed values**:
  * `"cover"`: The background image covers the entire width of the container. Its aspect ratio is preserved. Content may be clipped if the aspect ratio of the image doesn't match the aspect ratio of the container. **verticalAlignment** is respected (**horizontalAlignment** is meaningless since it's stretched width). This is the default mode and is the equivalent to the current model.
  * `"repeatHorizontally"`: The background image isn't stretched. It is repeated in the x axis as many times as necessary to cover the container's width. **verticalAlignment** is honored (default is **top**), **horizontalAlignment** is ignored.
  * `"repeatVertically"`: The background image isn't stretched. It is repeated in the y axis as many times as necessary to cover the container's height. **verticalAlignment** is ignored, **horizontalAlignment** is honored (default is **left**).
  * `"repeat"`: The background image isn't stretched. It is repeated first in the x axis then in the y axis as many times as necessary to cover the entire container. Both **horizontalAlignment** and **verticalAlignment** are honored (defaults are **left** and **top**).


## horizontalAlignment

Describes how the image should be aligned if it must be cropped or if using repeat fill mode.

* **Type**: `HorizontalAlignment`
* **Required**: No
* **Allowed values**:
  * `"left"`
  * `"center"`
  * `"right"`


## verticalAlignment

Describes how the image should be aligned if it must be cropped or if using repeat fill mode.

* **Type**: `VerticalAlignment`
* **Required**: No
* **Allowed values**:
  * `"top"`
  * `"center"`
  * `"bottom"`
