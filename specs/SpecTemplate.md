# Feature Proposal: [your title here] 

## Summary
Include 1-2 sentences summarizing your feature or schema change.

## Schema Changes
Does your feature include schema changes? If so, what are they?

## Rationale
Create a list that describes WHY the feature should be added to Adaptive Cards. Why is this feature needed and what scenarios will it enable.
* {First reason for why we should consider this proposal}
* {Second reason for why we should consider this proposal}
* {etc}

## Scope
Please include a list of what the features should and shouldn't do by filling the table below.
'Must' implies that the feature should not ship without this capability.  
'Should' is something we should push hard for, but is not absolutely required to ship.
'Could' is a nice-to-have; a good stretch goal that isn't painful if we don't achieve it.
'Won't' is a clear statement that the proposal/feature will intentionally not have that capability.


| Capability | Priority |
| :---------- | :------- |
| This proposal will allow developers to accomplish W | Must |
| This proposal will allow end users to accomplish X | Should |
| This proposal will allow developers to accomplish Y | Could |
| This proposal will allow end users to accomplish Z | Won't |

## Fallback impact
What will get shown in previous versions if your feature is not implemented?
