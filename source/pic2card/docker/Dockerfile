# Mystique App docker.
#
# Mystique make use of the rcnn based model to do the object detection, here
# we are employing two optional methods of accessing the models for prediction.
# 1. Model is embedded inside the docker itself, or as frozen model.
# 2. The model will be deployed in tf_serving service outside this service,
#    we access that api from here.
#
# Both has it's pros and cons, so we will use based on which fits at particular
# usecase at hand.
#
# To build docker image with TFS support
#   $docker build -t imaginea.azurecr.io/imaginea/api_frozen_mystique:v0.6 .
#
# To build pic2card with backend TFS service.
#   $docker build --build-arg tfs_enable=tfs --build-arg TARGET_API=tfs \
#      -t imaginea.azurecr.io/imaginea/api_tfs_mystique:v0.6 .
