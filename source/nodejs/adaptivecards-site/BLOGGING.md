# Authoring Blog Content

Writing a blog post is the most enjoyable thing you'll do today! ðŸ’¯

[Check out this example](./pages/_posts/2019/Community-Call-June.md)

## Getting Started

A blog post is nothing more than a file authored in the markdown syntax you already know and love.

1. Create a new markdown file in `./pages/_posts/<year>/<post-title>.md` (e.g., `./pages/_posts/2019/My-Cool-Blog-Post.md`)
2. Add post metadata to the top of the file (described below)
3. You can use all the normal markdown features you expect: images, hyperlinks, code snippets using ```, etc
4. To include images or other assets make a folder with the same name as your markdown file (e.g., `./pages/_posts/2019/My-Cool-Blog-Post/`)
5. Add any images into the folder
6. Reference them in your markdown file using standard markdown image syntax (e.g., `![Image description](My-Cool-Blog-Post/myimage.png)`
7. In VS Code, click the "Open Preview to the Side" button to preview your post (`Ctrl-K, V`)
8. When you feel good, commit it and open a PR!

## Post Metadata

The only other content you need in the post is called "front matter", and is YAML content that describes the post metadata. Put this at the very top of your markdown file.

```yaml
---
title: <REQUIRED> The title of your post, should be short and sweet
subtitle: <REQUIRED> A slightly longer subtitle that describes the post content
date: <REQUIRED> The post date YYYY-MM-DD
github_username: <REQUIRED> Your GitHub username
featured_image: <OPTIONAL> A "hero" image that aids the post visually (approx dimensions 294x172)
twitter: <OPTIONAL> Your twitter handle
---
```

**Example metadata:**

```yaml
---
title: ðŸŽ‰ Announcing Adaptive Cards 1.1
subtitle: All new drag-drop designer, a Media element, and more
date: 2018-10-12
featured_image: designer.png
github_username: matthidinger
twitter: matthidinger
---
```

## View the post on the website

This is the fun part -- let's see how your post looks on the actual website. As soon as you open a PR with your post, the build server will publish it to:

> `https://adaptivecardsci.z5.web.core.windows.net/pr/<PR_NUMBER>/blog`

Check it out, see how it looks, and send that URL to folks for feedback! When it's all good, merge it to main and it'll be live on `https://adaptivecards.io/blog`!

## Helpful VS Code extensions

- **[Paste Image](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mushan.vscode-paste-image)** lets your paste an image from your clipboard into your current VS Code project. This is so much nicer for quickly snipping screenshots, etc. 

  - **Usage:** `Ctrl+Alt+V` with an image in clipboard, enter filename

- **[Markdown paste](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=telesoho.vscode-markdown-paste-image)** is great if you need to paste HTML content as markdown. 

	- **Usage:** `Ctrl+Alt+V` with HTML content in clipboard will convert it to markdown


## BONUS: Put Adaptive Cards in your posts

Yep, you read that right: you can even include **real-live Adaptive Cards** in your blog posts!

**Syntax**

```
{% adaptivecard <URL-TO-PAYLOAD> %}
```

### Optiona A: Using a card payload for a specific blog post

If you want to use a card specific to the post you're writing, just follow the same steps above on adding images/assets to the post.

Then reference it by file-name:

```
{% adaptivecard ExpenseReport.json %}
```

See the [Community Call from June 2019](./pages/_posts/2019/Community-Call-June.md) for example usage.

### Option B: Using a payload on the web

Otherwise you can use a payload that is accessible via HTTP. Make sure CORS is set properly on the URL though. 

If it fails to render, check the browser debug tools under the Network tab.

```
{% adaptivecard https://cdn.adaptivecards.io/releaseshelper/releasescard.json %}
```
