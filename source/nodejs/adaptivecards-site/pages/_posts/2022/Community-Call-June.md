In this monthâ€™s community call the focus is on the newly released Teams Toolkit v4.0. This latest Teams VS Code extension enables developers/non-developers to create Teams apps with minimal work. v4 capabilities called out include scenario-based app creation, run your Teams apps on Office and Outlook, create an app from sample, select to uncomment/activate commented out capabilities, and see your new app in Run and Debug mode.
