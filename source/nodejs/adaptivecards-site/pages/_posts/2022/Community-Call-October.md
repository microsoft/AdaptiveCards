The focus in this monthâ€™s community call is **Building Windows 11 Widgets with Adaptive Cards** and post demo related **Q&A.** This call was hosted by [J.P. Roca](http://twitter.com/jpthepm) (Microsoft) \| @jpthepm. Recorded on October 13, 2022. The 3rd party Widgets Platform allows developers to create a widget for their Win32 or Progressive Web Apps also known as PWAâ€™s. PWA support will be coming later this year. Users will then be able to see and interact with this widget on the widgets board. 3rd party widgets are not meant to be a replacement for your app, but instead provide users with another way to engage with your app in a glanceable and focused way. The first preview of this platform that allows developers to start creating Widgets for their app has shipped as part of the Windows App SDK 1.2 preview 2 release. 

As part of this preview release, developers are able to locally test their 3P widgets as long as they meet the prerequisites outlined in [Implement a widget provider in a win32 app](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/develop/widgets/implement-widget-provider-win32). 3P widgets will be available in official releases of Windows 11 in a future date. This documentation provides developers with everything they need to get started building 3P widgets using Adaptive Cards. For any problems you are experiencing, please file an issue in the [Windows App SDK repository](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK).
