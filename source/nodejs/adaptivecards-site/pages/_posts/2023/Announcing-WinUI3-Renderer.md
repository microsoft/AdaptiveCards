Our team is excited to share that we have officially released the WinUI 3 renderer for Adaptive Cards! This release would not have been possible without all the help from the WinUI 3 team so we would like to thank them for their valuable contribution to Adaptive Cards. The WinUI 3 renderer brings exciting new capabilities to both developers and end users that we will go over in this post. 

### What does this mean for developers?
If you are a developer, the WinUI 3 renderer will enable you to render Adaptive Cards inside your WinUI 3 applications. You can even choose to override the styling of elements found in Adaptive Cards to make them specific for your application. You can find the NuGet package [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AdaptiveCards.Rendering.Winui3) and learn more about using this renderer in your application from our [developer documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/adaptive-cards/sdk/rendering-cards/winui-3/getting-started).

### What does this mean for end users?
For users of Adaptive Cards, the WinUI 3 renderer means a seamless and responsive card-viewing experience for any WinUI 3 application they may use. This doesn't mean you will see Adaptive Cards in all the WinUI 3 applications you use, but it does mean that developers now have the option to use Adaptive Cards if they find a use for their application. If you use a WinUI 3 application and think it would benefit from using Adaptive Cards, make sure to let their team know this option is now available!
