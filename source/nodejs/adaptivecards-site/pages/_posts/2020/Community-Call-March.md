Agenda for this month's call, hosted by Matt Hidinger, included a conversation about the new concept we are calling the Adaptive Cards Management System (ACMS). Our team working on this showed a preview of the ACMS admin portal, how to render an adaptive card on Microsoft Teams using Power Automate and what's next to turn this preview into a live offering.

### A live preview of the "Adaptive Card Management System" (ACMS)

We're excited to share an early exploration of a concept we're calling the "Adaptive Cards Management System (ACMS)". ACMS is a supplementary product of Adaptive Cards that allows business users and professional developers to create, organize, and use Adaptive Card templates all within a cohesive turn-key solution.

ACMS is comprised of two parts:

-   **Front-end card management portal**: Designers or frontend developers can design and publish Adaptive Card templates directly within the user-friendly web-based interface.
-   **Back-end REST API**: Developers can utilize the ACMS REST API to retrieve published Adaptive Card templates and bind it with data dynamically.

### A preview of the ACMS Admin Portal

On the **Admin Portal Dashboard**, users can see a summary of card management. Users can browse recently edited and recently viewed cards as well as tags which are associated with their cards.

On the **New Template** page, users can create and edit Adaptive Cards. Users can expect to create Adaptive Cards effortlessly since [Adaptive Cards Designer Tool](https://adaptivecards.io/designer/) is nicely embedded into the ACMS Admin Portal.

If you click a card on the Dashboard, users will land in **Template View** page where they can check all the details of the card. They can share and publish cards here too! If users **publish** a card template, it can later be retrieved at "run-time" via the ACMS REST API.

### Now, let's render an adaptive card on Microsoft Teams using Power Automate!

Once you publish your card, you can retrieve your cards through ACMS API!

Now what I want to do is render my adaptive card on Microsoft Teams channel using Microsoft Power Automate. Here, I am getting my card using ACMS API through Microsoft Power Automate. After that, I am passing my card into Teams Connector to render the card on Teams Channel.

Once I trigger the power automate flow, voila, the adaptive card is rendered on Teams!

### What's Next?

In the short-term, we are working on improved template versioning and sharing features. We are hoping to cover these in more details on the April community call!

In the long-term, we are still working out the best way to turn this product from an exploration into a full-fledged offering. **If this product would help you at your workplace,** [**please let us know!**](https://portal.productboard.com/adaptivecards/1-adaptive-cards-features/c/55-card-author-services)
