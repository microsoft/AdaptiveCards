Welcome to our Adaptive Cards community call series for 2019, the 2nd Thursday of each month. We are excited to provide you with a monthly opportunity to learn about Adaptive Cards in general, how they could be a great tool in your applications and contribute to the evolution of the format and SDKs. Each month, we'll discuss new features we are bringing to the platform, our roadmap, and listen to your feedback and suggestions.

Agenda for this month's call, hosted by Matt Hidinger, included:

## Cisco WebEx Teams ðŸ’™ Adaptive Cards

Cisco WebEx Teams announced that their bot platform will be [powered by Adaptive Cards](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.webex.com%2Fdocs%2Fapi%2Fguides%2Fcards&data=02%7C01%7CMatt.Hidinger%40microsoft.com%7C43458ee724c840a062d608d73c8d396a%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637044449791399165&sdata=ABBjQbsGMGNl5EKNrl3cc3DbOb4N2OjxJOhva3V3aAI%3D&reserved=0).Â  They also deeply integrated the [Adaptive Card Designer](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fadaptive-cards%2Fsdk%2Fdesigner&data=02%7C01%7CMatt.Hidinger%40microsoft.com%7C43458ee724c840a062d608d73c8d396a%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637044449791399165&sdata=eg4AzOb6%2BdlWU7c3mRtkcbwy29kiNAyzFbWxfhia3%2Bs%3D&reserved=0) into their development portal, creating a seamless end-to-end card experience for their customers.

We're thrilled that this announcement takes our industry one step closer to a standardized card exchange format. Cisco's Adam Kalsey [says it best](https://developer.webex.com/blog/did-you-see-the-new-api-features-we-announced-at-cisco-live-):

"We've joined Microsoft's efforts to create a standard for these sorts of cards, ensuring that you can take advantage of the wide application and tooling support as Adaptive Cards grows in popularity."
