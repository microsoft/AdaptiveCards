Welcome to our Adaptive Cards community call series for 2019, the 2nd Thursday of each month. We are excited to provide you with a monthly opportunity to learn about Adaptive Cards in general, how they could be a great tool in your applications and contribute to the evolution of the format and SDKs. Each month, we'll discuss new features we are bringing to the platform, our roadmap, and listen to your feedback and suggestions.

Agenda for this month's call, hosted by **Matt Hidinger**, included:

### Build 2019 Debrief

The Microsoft Build conference took place last week and the Adaptive Cards team had the opportunity to share some real-world use cases and an early look at what we're planning. Have a look at the full session below, or the community call recap for a more condensed version.

**What about the source code?**

Throughout the talk we refer to a *Contoso Healthcare* sample app for the web and Android. We're currently cleaning up the code and adding proper documentation, and plan to release it in the coming weeks. Check back on this blog post or the [Adaptive Cards GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/AdaptiveCards) repo shortly to check it out.
