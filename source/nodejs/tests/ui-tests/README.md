# Getting started

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests make sure the adaptivecards-ui-testapp project has been built and is running, you can follow the steps detailed [here](../../adaptivecards-ui-testapp/README.md)

In a terminal, move to this directory `cd source/nodejs/tests/ui-tests`

## Building

1. Execute the `build` task `npm run build`

## Executing the tests

1. Execute the `test` task `npm run test`. This step rebuilds the test so you should not have to rebuild manually everytime you make a test change.
