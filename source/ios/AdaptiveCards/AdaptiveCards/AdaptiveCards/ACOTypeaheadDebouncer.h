 @brief A helper class which implements the debounce operation.
 @discussion TSDebouncer is a helper which implements the debounce operation on
             a stream of data. e.g. When user is typing in a UITextField, each
             edit operation is pushed into the debouncer, but the debouncer will
             only perform the callback when a certain minimum time has been elapsed
             since last keystroke by the user.
